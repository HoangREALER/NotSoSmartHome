# NotSoSmartHome

## This is our MULTIDISCIPLINARY PROJECT.


## These are steps to run and debug the program


### Step 1
First you have to install:
- Android Studio. Make sure you also install AVD. Currently it is being developed on a hardware called *Pixel XL* with the system image of *S, API level 31*.
- Make sure you follow [React-Native environment setup guideline](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup). Take note you don't have to initiate a new project as we will use this project to develop. You only need to setup some environment variable and have nodejs on your device.

=================================================================
### Step 2
Clone the repo to your device. Make sure you have Git on your computer. Use these commands to clone
```
git clone https://github.com/HoangREALER/NotSoSmartHome
cd NotSoSmartHome
```

=================================================================
### Step 4
Run this command to start the app:
